## Tippin Extension - Chrome

This an alpha implementation. It has just a couple of hours of work, it doesn't even use react yet; It's almost a proof of concept. Nevertheless, it's able to show a tippin button inside of every Tweet. 


## How to use it

You don't need a tippin.me account, but the receiver does.
Once the extension is installed, it injects a Tippin.me button in every tweet (at Twitter.com).

Since tippin.me uses Twitter usernames, every button opens his respective Tippin profile (which could not exist yet).

## Details

It's clumsy and fast, but shows what it could do in the future.

hola@tippin.me
